In cloud computing model there are different stakeholder involved:cloud provider,service provider and customer.This leads to the following issus:
1.each stakeholder has thier own security management processes used to define their assets,expected risks and thier impacts and how deal such risks.
2.In multi tenant environment  the protection requirement for each tenant might differ, set of security requirement defined on a service should be maintained nad enforced on the service instances level and at runtime taking into the possibilty of changing requirements based on current customer need to mitigate new risks.
3.Also,there is chance that some of customer are themslves the attackers,thus generating complex trust issues.
